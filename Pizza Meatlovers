INSTRUCTIONS
ASSEMBLY OF THE MEAT LOVERS PIZZA:
Prepare one recipe of my Homemade Pizza Dough and my Homemade Pizza Sauce. Alternatively, you could use store-bought. 
Preheat oven to 475°F and allow to heat for at least 30 minutes. Grease a pizza pan with cooking spray and sprinkle with cornmeal. 
If you prefer a thin crust, roll out dough into a circle using a rolling pin. If you want a thicker crust, flatten and stretch on prepared pizza pan or hold the dough up on one side and quickly move your hands around the edges to stretch it out. Use your fingers to push up the edges to create a crust. Let dough rest for 10-15 minutes before topping. 
Brush the crust with olive oil, top with about ½ cup to 1 cup of pizza sauce, shredded cheeses, pepperoni slices, cooked sausage and crumbled bacon. 
Bake in preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until the edges of the crust are golden brown. 
If you prefer a darker crust, move pan to the top rack and bake for another 1-2 minutes. Allow pizza to cool for about 3-5 minutes. Slice and serve!
